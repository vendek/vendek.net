Obelisk is a fine working title. I kind of like it, but it recently came to my attention (only after making a cool logo with a *2001*-esque monolith) that the monolith in the logo isn't technically an obelisk.
An [obelisk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obelisk) can be a monolith, but a [monolith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monolith) isn't necessarily an obelisk.
