Vendek is an experimental operating system early in development written in (and tightly bound to) a new language, Obelisk. It acts as a testbed for importing advances in other areas such as language design & distributed version control into the operating system space while ruthlessly simplifying traditional designs.

Right now, I'm compiling a "wishlist" of features and concepts for Vendek. I have a vague idea of how they'll fit together, but it remains to be seen how many of these ideas can coexist.
