Obelisk is an experimental programming language early in development ("brainstorming" would be more accurate). I'm currently working on a "wishlist" of abilities & features for the language. When the wishlist is done, it'll be turned into a coherent set of language features implementing as many "wishes" as possible (although language simplicity is a feature in itself).
